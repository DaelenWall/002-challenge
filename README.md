# 002-challenge


## Description
In this chapter 2 challenge I took my knowledge of both HTML and CSS and used it to create my very own personal online Portfolio.  I now have a valuable asset to use in my journey towards becoming a web developer as I can use this Portfolio whenever I choose to apply for jobs or even attract a potential employer.



## Process
After creating my repository, I started with outlining my HTML and CSS with the various different sections I wanted to have in my Portfolio.  I did this using comments like !<----README----->, to help me navigate through the code.
![alt=sectioning]("")


Then, I started writing in my HTML tags for each section based on how I knew I wanted my webpage to look.
![alt=html]("")


Next, I added in my images.  Only a few, but still a valuable step.
![alt=images]("")


Then, I worked through 300 lines of CSS using the tags that I had already set up in my HTML.  These lines included lots of color-coding, margin-editing, and flex-wraping.
![alt=css]("")


Finally, I added in my media queries at the bottom of my CSS.  I noticed that the only section that I had trouble with after my flex-wraping was my "Work" section.  So I made sure to edit that section so that the cards would go from rows to columns as the webpage got smaller.
![alt=mediaqueries]("")



## Conclusion
All in all, it was a fun project to work on.  I'm not sure that front-end web development is really my forte, nor do I enjoy it as much as back-end, but it was definitely valuable to learn and study.  Plus, I now have an online Portfolio to share with employers.  It did take me a little while to complete this project as well, but by looking through previous lessons and watching class recordings, I was able to work everything out pretty efficiently.
